          Since 2011, Apple has been the world's largest company by market
          capitalization except when Microsoft held the position between January
          and June 2024.[6][7][8]
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          In 2022, Apple was the largest technology company by revenue, with
          US$394.3 billion.[9][failed verification] As of 2023, Apple was the
          fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales,[10] the largest
          manufacturing company by revenue, and the largest vendor of mobile
          phones in the world.[11] It is one of the Big Five American
          information technology companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent
          company of Google), Amazon, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), and
          Microsoft.

          Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to
          produce and market Steve Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. The
          company was incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second
          computer, the Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first
          mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and
          the Macintosh in 1984, as some of the first computers to use a
          graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, the company's internal
          problems included the high cost of its products and power struggles
          between executives. That year Jobs left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and
          Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The market for personal computers
          expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s, and Apple lost considerable
          market share to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of the Microsoft
          Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC clones.
