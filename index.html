      Since 2011, Apple has been the world's largest company by market
      capitalization except when Microsoft held the position between January and
      June 2024.[6][7][8]

      In 2022, Apple was the largest technology company by revenue, with
      US$394.3 billion.[9][failed verification] As of 2023, Apple was the
      fourth-largest personal computer vendor by unit sales,[10] the largest
      manufacturing company by revenue, and the largest vendor of mobile phones
      in the world.[11] It is one of the Big Five American information
      technology companies, alongside Alphabet (the parent company of Google),
      Amazon, Meta (the parent company of Facebook), and Microsoft.

      Apple was founded as Apple Computer Company on April 1, 1976, to produce
      and market Steve Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. The company was
      incorporated by Wozniak and Steve Jobs in 1977. Its second computer, the
      Apple II, became a best seller as one of the first mass-produced
      microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in
      1984, as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and
      a mouse. By 1985, the company's internal problems included the high cost
      of its products and power struggles between executives. That year Jobs
      left Apple to form NeXT, Inc., and Wozniak withdrew to other ventures. The
      market for personal computers expanded and evolved throughout the 1990s,
      and Apple lost considerable market share to the lower-priced Wintel
      duopoly of the Microsoft Windows operating system on Intel-powered PC
      clones.
